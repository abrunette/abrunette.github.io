							A Romaji to English translator.
						</td>
						<td class="about">
							<p>
								This project required us to design and implement a scanner, parser, and translator for Japanese romaji into english.<br><br>
								We implemented it in three parts, scanner, parser, and translator, building on the previous parts to add more functionality.
								The scanner scans words in a text file and determines if they are valid Japanese words. That is to say, they match up with the
								Japanese syllabary using a DFA map. If they do, they are matched to a certain type to be used later in the parser. Otherwise they are marked ERROR.<br><br>
								In the parser, the words are checked, in order, after they are scanned to determine if they match a pre-defined BNF grammar rule.
								If they reach the end, then the sentence is valid, otherwise it is wrong and the user has an option to correct it or end the program.<br><br>
								Within the parser functions there are calls to translation functions. If the words are matched to a valid english word they will be
								replaced in the output.<br><br>
								Several arrays and a map are used to match words to their respective types or translations. There are also some
								extra functions to improve quality of life for the user, allow for debugging, and make the output easier to understand.

							A program that uses a TLB and paging table to manage physical and virtual memory.
						</td>
						<td class="about">
							<p>
								This project consisted of writing a program that translates logical to physical addresses for a virtual address space of size 216 = 65,536 bytes. 
								The program will read from a file containing logical addresses and, using a TLB as well as a page table, will translate each logical address 
								to its corresponding physical address and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address. The goal behind this project 
								is to simulate the steps involved in translating logical to physical addresses.<br><br>
								The program will read a file containing several 32-bit integer numbers that represent logical addresses. However, it only looks at 
								16-bit addresses, so it masks the rightmost 16 bits of each logical address. These 16 bits are divided into an 8-bit page number and an 8-bit page offset.<br><br>
								Memory specifics:<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
									<li>28 entries in the page table</li>
									<li>Page size of 28 bytes</li>
									<li>16 entries in the TLB</li>
									<li>Frame size of 28 bytes</li>
									<li>256 frames</li>
									<li>Physical memory of 65,536 bytes (256 frames × 256-byte frame size)</li>
								</ul>

							My personal website providing quick access to my resume, coding projects, photography, contact information, and information about me.
						</td>
						<td class="about">
							<p>
								This site was meant to be a test site for me to learn the basics of web development as a side project and hobby. Its original purpose was to serve
								as an alternative location for my resume. While designing my resume I added additional scalability so I could show off my other hobbies.<br><br>
								This project has been very useful in developing not only my own methods of software design, but improving my code structure, development protocols, and
								scalability that has had lasting impact on my software design outside of web development.
								It has also improved my creativity which is something I am deficient in and continue to improve.<br><br>
								This will most likely be a permanently ongoing project as I branch further into web development and improve my programming skills in a casual setting.
								It will also be my staging area for future developments in technology that I have an interest in.<br><br>
								My current plans for this site are to implement a responsive mobile site, learn and add Javascript, and implement ReactJS.
